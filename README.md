# Taipei-Poetry-Project
Taipei Poetry Map is an interactive website made of 360Â° panorama pictures with stylized texts floating inside. This website allows visitors to explore the hustle and bustle of Taipei. Visitors can also hear the sound of the city by touching those floating texts. The texts are random sentences picked up from the street such as a conversation between friends, vendor hawking, people complaining about the weather etc. There is no direct connection between each text. However, these sentences do exist in the same place. All the texts will show up in a small blank in the centre of the screen in order after touched. This meaningless composition of texts can be considered as a poem, a kind of poetry that belongs to this special location. The visitor can download this poem and post it on social media with #TaipeiPoetryMap if they willing to do it.
